# Code-vis
A visual representation of JavaScript programs

## Description
JavaScript Code Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to help developers understand JavaScript code execution visually. Users can paste or write their JavaScript code into the visualizer to step through it incrementally. The visualizer interprets the code and generates corresponding React components to represent the code's behavior.

## Current Status
As of now, the project is in its initial development phase and includes:
- Integrated code editor using the Monaco editor: https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/
- Parser and AST builder using Esprima: https://esprima.org/
- An interpreter for basic JavaScript
- A foundational system for creating simple React components to represent variables
